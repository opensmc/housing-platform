This is a piece of python3 code that acts to turn a chunk of data into an xlsx file (which can
then be transformed into whatever the State of California wants). I haven't quite figured out
what's going to be done since I don't know what's going to be needed. Expect this to be updated
as soon as I figure out what's going on.
