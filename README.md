## Pilot Housing Platform for San Mateo County

### Problem

Every year, all cities within the State of California must report on their respective housing production to the California Department of Housing & Community Development (HCD), a process that can take a significant amount of staff time for local agencies because it often involves taking data from a permit database and manually imputing data into the State form and leaving much room for human error.  Here is an [example](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Dkl7WTLeSQubZj0i41Nh3y_kcRrICYNv4OVkGMf9tdg/edit?usp=sharing) of the form that was filled out by all California cities in 2015.  These reported housing numbers are then used as the basis for establishing future housing production targets that every city in the State is asked to meet.   

### Goal

In partership with the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) ([http://www.abag.ca.gov](http://www.abag.ca.gov)) and 21 Elements ([http://www.21elements.com/About-Us/about.html](http://www.21elements.com/About-Us/about.html)), OpenSMC will be developing a Pilot Housing Platform to simplify the way in which cities report annual housing construction activity to the HCD and ABAG.  The goal with the Pilot Housing Platform is to simplify the reporting process by transforming the [form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Dkl7WTLeSQubZj0i41Nh3y_kcRrICYNv4OVkGMf9tdg/edit?usp=sharing) into an easy interface that cities can use to input housing production data.

### Participating Cities

The following six cities have volunteered to participate and share their user experience with the existing reporting process and to share their housing production data:

- City of Redwood City
- City of Belmont
- City of San Mateo
- Town of Hillsborough
- City of Millbrae
- City of South San Francisco

### Next Steps

- By September 9, 2016, collect housing production data from the volunteer cities.  A [google shared folder](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0Bxf3wUOZwMIOei1Wa2FCd1Rwem8&usp=sharing) has been created to collect the datasets.  So far, we have data from Redwood City between 2011-2015 and reported housing production numbers from all Bay Area cities between 2007-2014.
- September 13, 2016:  Schedule a whiteboard session to brainstorm on the design of platform and build a team.
